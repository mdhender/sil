// descriptor is used to represent all pointers, integers, and real
// numbers. A descriptor may be thought of as the basic "word" of
// SNOBOL4. Descriptors consist of three fixed-length fields:
//   address
//   flag
//   value
// The size and position of these fields is determined from the data
// they must represent and the way that they are used in the various
// operations. The following paragraphs describe some specific
// requirements.
//
//
// On the IBM System/360, a descriptor is two words (eight bytes).
// The first word is the address field. The second word consists of
// one byte for the flag field and three bytes for the value field.
// The three bytes (24 bits) for the value field permits
// representation of data objects as large as 2^24-1 bytes. On the
// other hand, two bytes would limit objects to 2^16-1 bytes. Since
// on the IBM System/360 there are eight bytes per descriptor,
// 2^16-1 bytes would limit objects to 8191 descriptors, which would
// be too restrictive. For machines with fewer address units per
// descriptor, the value field need not be as large
//
// S4D58.PDF: 3.1

	// The address field of a descriptor must be large enough to
	// address any descriptor, specifier, or program instruction
	// within the SNOBOL4 system.
	//   (Descriptors do not have to address individual characters
	//    of strings. See Section 3.2.)
	// The address field must also be large enough to contain any
	// integer or real number (including sign) that is to be used
	// in a SNOBOL4 program. The address field is the most
	// frequently used field of a descriptor and is used frequently
	// for addressing and integer arithmetic and it should be
	// positioned so that these operations can be performed efficiently
	//
	// S4D58.PDF: 3.1.1
	address address
	// The flag field is used to represent the states of a number of
	// disjoint conditions and is treated as a set of bits that are
	// individually tested, turned on, and turned off.
	// Five flag bits used in SNOBOL4.
	//
	// S4D58.PDF: 3.1.2
	flag int
	// The value field is used to represent a number of internal
	// quantities that are represented as unsigned integers
	// (magnitudes). These quantities the encoded representation
	// of source-language data types, the length of strings, and
	// the size (in address units) of various data aggregates.
	// The value field need not be as large as the address field,
	// but it must be large enough to represent the size of the
	// largest data aggregate that can be formed.

// Specifiers are used to refer to character strings. Almost all
// operations performed on character strings are handled through
// operations on specifiers. All specifiers are the same size and
// have five fields:
//   address
//   flag
//   value
//   offset
//   length
// Specifiers and descriptors may be stored in the same area
// indiscriminately, and are indistinguishable to many processes in
// the SNOBOL4 system. As a result, specifiers are composed of two
// descriptors. One descriptor is used in the standard way to
// provide the address, flag, and value fields. The other descriptor
// is used in a nonstandard way. Its address field is used to
// represent the offset of an individual character from the address
// given in the specifierâ€™s address field. The value field of this
// other descriptor is used for the length.
